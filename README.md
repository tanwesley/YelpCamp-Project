# YelpCamp-Project
An Express.js web application for users to review and add campgrounds around the United States. Made using MongoDB as a database.
This project was built during my enrollment in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course which teaches web development using a Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap stack.
